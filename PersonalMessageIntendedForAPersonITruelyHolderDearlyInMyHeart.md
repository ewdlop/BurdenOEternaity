You(still E) have the lever. Forgive me if I made this public but I don't know how to reach out to you besides through this way. 
In the normal Trolley Problem, if I would you I would see if you can break the rails first...
Be careful with this one too...think carefully... and don't make a swift decision...
Anyway, I might have messed up our friendships badly, but I just want you to know that I missed the good old days.
I hope you are doing well. Truly yours.
