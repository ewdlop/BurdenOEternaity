(Some afterthought that I have been thinking for a while I guess it has been in back of my mine I just dont realize..I suppose..)(ignore GOD)

I am somone's favorite and I am being dislike by somebody because of it but 

I am just trying to compare the sentence:

I belong to someone vs saying someone belongs me

UNIVERSE is like saying You need to move on from your live else GOD going to try to take out your girlfreind and I am the you

I am like how is this fair AND DONT MAKE ME DO IT! By doing what you might say....I am going to do the unspeakable!...Dont tell me!...

Obvious not I AM going to SPEAK CHINESE to fight this double entendre BS...it is like ENGLISH is messed up right now!!

I had a flash back of the cartoon with Red Guy in it...(facepalm what is going on....)

I swear I jsut saw a cockroach...and I saw a rat in my home other day and my dad told to clean the house in the morning other day some day last week if I recall correctly..I forget if I was on a call with my coworkers though...)
