# Emergency Communication Guidelines

In case of an emergency, we encourage contributors to leave a message via a Pull Request (PR). This process ensures that the message is logged, visible to maintainers, and can be addressed promptly.

## Steps to Leave an Emergency Message

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Navigate to the top right corner of this repository and click the "Fork" button to create a copy of this repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**:
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine using:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
     ```

3. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Create a new branch to leave your emergency message:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b emergency-message
     ```

4. **Add Your Message**:
   - Create a new file in the root directory named `EMERGENCY.md`.
   - Add your emergency message to this file. Please include as much detail as possible.
     ```markdown
     # Emergency Message

     **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

     **Time**: HH:MM

     **Message**:
     ```
     - Provide detailed information about the emergency situation.

5. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - Commit your changes with a clear and concise message:
     ```sh
     git add EMERGENCY.md
     git commit -m "Added emergency message"
     ```

6. **Push the Branch to Your Forked Repository**:
   - Push the newly created branch to your forked repository:
     ```sh
     git push origin emergency-message
     ```

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Compare & pull request" button.
   - Provide a clear title and description for your PR, mentioning that it is an emergency communication.

## Additional Notes

- **Confidentiality**: If your message contains sensitive information, please mark it clearly and request restricted access.
- **Urgency**: Indicate the urgency of your message so it can be prioritized accordingly.
- **Follow-Up**: If possible, follow up with an additional method of communication (e.g., email) to ensure the message is received.

Thank you for helping us maintain clear and efficient communication during emergencies.
